## Ticket Guidelines

- **Bugs**:
  - Contain steps to reproduce.
  - Contain a code sample that exhibits the error.
  - *Ideally* contain your scalameta/semanticdb versions.
  - *Ideally* contain the scala version you are using.
  - Inform us if the issue is blocking you with no visible workaround
    - This will give the ticket priority
- **Features**
  - Show a code example of how that feature would be used.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **All code PRs should**:
  - have a meaningful commit message description
  - comment important things
  - include unit tests (positive and negative)
  - pass [CI](http://drone.geirsson.com:8001/scalameta/scalameta), which
    automatically runs when your pull request is submitted.
  - be reformatted with `./bin/scalafmt`
  - add a relevant entry to the
    [changelog](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/tree/master/changelog)
    for the next stable release
- **Be prepared to discuss/argue-for your changes if you want them merged**!
  You will probably need to refactor so your changes fit into the larger
  codebase
- **If your code is hard to unit test, and you don't want to unit test it,
  that's ok**. But be prepared to argue why that's the case!
- **It's entirely possible your changes won't be merged**, or will get ripped
  out later. This is also the case for maintainer changes, even
  [@xeno-by](https://github.com/xeno-by)!
- **Even a rejected/reverted PR is valuable**! It helps explore the solution
  space, and know what works and what doesn't. For every line in the repo, at
  least three lines were tried, committed, and reverted/refactored, and more
  than 10 were tried without committing.
- **Feel free to send Proof-Of-Concept PRs** that you don't intend to get merged.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Prefer the terms `enrichment` and `extension` as opposed to `pimp`

In case of any questions, don't hesitate to ask on our
