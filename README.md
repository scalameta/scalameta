### scala.meta

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/scalameta/scalameta](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/scalameta/scalameta?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Scala.meta is based on a principle that metaprogramming should be completely decoupled from compiler internals.
This project is a clean-room implementation of a metaprogramming toolkit for Scala, designed to be simple, robust and portable.
We are striving for scala.meta to become a successor of scala.reflect, the current de facto standard in Scala ecosystem.

### How to use

This project is still in alpha stage, so it's not supposed to be immediately usable just yet.
Nevertheless, we are regularly publishing snapshot builds to Sonatype, so it is already possible to experiment with scala.meta
as described at [https://github.com/scalameta/example](https://github.com/scalameta/example).

As with any snapshot software, things may crash and burn and APIs may noticeably change overnight,
but if you're brave enough, proceed using the instructions, and you may find hidden treasures!

### How to contribute

We have been lucky to receive a number of important contributions from a lot of enthusiasts -
both internally at EPFL and externally over the internet. If you are interested in leaving your mark
in the design and implementation of the metaprogramming toolkit of the future, check out
