# Scala.meta 1.7.0


## Upgrade guide

Contrib:
- `equal` has been renamed to `isEqual` to avoid accidentally using `equals`,
  which always compiles but does the wrong thing at runtime.
- `isEqual` defaults to structual equality, so it's not longer necessary to
  write `[Structurally]` in `a.isEqual[Structurally](b)`.
- `(a: Subtype).isEqual(b: Supertype)` will no longer compile, either upcast
  `a: Supertype` or swap the order to `b.isEqual(a)`
- The `Extract[A, B]` typeclass has been added.
  - This means that you can extract Stats/Mods/Annotations etc.
  - eg. `q"@Foo @Bar sealed final class Foo".extract[Annotations]`
  - eg. `q"trait Foo[A] { def bar = 2; val baz = 2}".extract[Vals]`
  - In future this will be supplemented by the ability to replace/update based on extract.
  - In future we will also add many more extractors. 
  - If you would like a specific extractor implemented, please open a ticket or send us a pull request.
